Idea for evolutionary algorithm sandbox project:

Organisms are collections of blocks that can move in the x and y axis. Different blocks interact with each other in different ways. There are attack blocks, body blocks, reproduction blocks, and brain blocks. When an attack block touches any block, including attack blocks, that block is destroyed. If the block destroyed is a body block or brain block, the organism gains one mass point. If it is a reproduction block, the attacking organism gains as many mass points as the damaged organism, divided by how many reproduction blocks the damaged organism has. If an organism loses all of its brain blocks, the neural network that controls how the organism moves is disabled. If an organism loses all of its reproduction blocks, it loses all of its mass points and can no longer reproduce. Once an organism has collected enough mass points (at least as many mass points as blocks the organism consists of), it will be able to reproduce when it has the space to do so. Organisms are confined to 10x10 blocks, and they can sense everything within a 20x20 block area (this area is the area in which the organism is centered in).
